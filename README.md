# Scripts for Arachneia

This repository contains scripts designed to be used with the program "Arachneia." The scripts are organized into two main categories: Full Releases and Work In Progress (WIP).

## Structure

- `FullReleases`: This folder contains all completed scripts that are ready for use. These scripts have been tested and are considered stable for integration with Arachneia.
- `WIP`: The Work In Progress folder holds scripts that are currently under development. They may not be fully functional and are subject to change.

## Using the Scripts

To use these scripts with Arachneia, follow the steps below:

1. Choose a script from either the `FullReleases` or `WIP` folders, depending on your needs and the stability you require.
2. Consult the specific documentation for each script (if available) for instructions on how to integrate and use it with Arachneia.
3. Copy the script into your Arachneia scripts directory, or follow the integration instructions provided with each script.
